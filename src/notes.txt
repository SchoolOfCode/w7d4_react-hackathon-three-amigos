To Do list app.

In valerio's head
Create an app component and have an input field and maybe a button "add" -unique component

Under the input have a component called "list" with multiple "list items" reusable components

Start simple with a MVP...just adds to the to-do list and deletes from the list.

Step by step plan:
{
As a first step,create input field and button
Second step, Create list and list items
third step, add list item to list when button is pressed
Once first 3 steps are working, we build onto it.
}

States and props 
{
    "React applications are about managing their own state"
    App sits at the top and is the smart component, keeps track of list components, this 
    will be an array that takes list items.
    The state will keep track of input field and what the input field "triggered by onChange" is 
    doing (event listener). Button will also have a "onClick listener".
    The props will be what are being sent down from app to input field and button so props will be the listeners 
    from the button and input field (onChange and onClick). Our list buttons will have as props each item from 
    the array which listens to the state of the application.
}
We need to make sure our index.js that lives inside app are linked with index.js outside our src folder.
